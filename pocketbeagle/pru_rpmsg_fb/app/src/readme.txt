Original fb.c works with ILI9341 based LCDs with device tree PB-TFT-ILI9348-SPI0.dts. I would ran the code with ST7735 based more smaller LCD then removed image x4 code of original fb.c, that is fb.qqvga.c.

If someone who would like to work with ST7735 based LCD, switch orignal fb.c with fb.qqvga.c and use ST7735-00A0.dts with it.
